# What is Flow?

Flow is project definition framework created in Eyedea. It uses JSON files to generate complete product definition on all levels: from user flows to the basic components. It's output can be used by product owners, project managers, UX/UI designers and developers.

## Flow files schema

This repository contains sample definition of a single flow. Whole schema is based on the following files: 

 - `actions.js` - definition of actions - what user can do 
 - `components.js` - definition of components - what is used for doing the action
 - `contexts.js` - definition of context - where and when user is doing actions
 - `endpoints.js` - definition of endpoints - what is the API / source of data
 - `flows.js` - definition of flows - what is the user journey for achieving the goal
 - `user-stories.js` - definition of user stories - what are the possibilities of actions in context
